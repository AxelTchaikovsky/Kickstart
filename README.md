# Learning schedule

This learning schedule is sorted out for *reseachers* or *whoever interested in machine learning / deep learning / computer vision*. It's also most welcomed for *instructors* to refer to this schedule to train beginner students. Each course listed below takes about *two weeks* to finish if you are fully dedicated to it. 


## Beginner

These courses are for beginners. It's suggested to follow the order below. Try to finish the coding and mathematics homework in each course. It helps a lot. 

* **Andrew Ng (Stanford)'s Machine Learning** [`Homepage`](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) video link: [`Youtube`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPLop4L2eGk&list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN) [`Bilibili`](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av9912938?from=search&seid=15017482190596014618)

* **Hsuan-Tien Lin (NTU)'s Machine Learning Foundations** [`Homepage`](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/course/mlfound18fall/) video link: [`Youtube`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXVfgk9fNX2I7tB6oIINGBmW50rrmFTqf) [`Bilibili`](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av12463015?from=search&seid=2676600341812801404)
* **Hsuan-Tien Lin (NTU)'s Machine Learning Techniques** [`Homepage`](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/course/mltech18spring/) video link: [`Youtube`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXVfgk9fNX2IQOYPmqjqWsNUFl2kpk1U2) [`Bilibili`](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av12469267?from=search&seid=2676600341812801404)

* **Feifei Li (Stanford)'s Computer Vision (CS231n)** [`Homepage`](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) video link: [`Youtube`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv
) [`Bilibili`](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av13260183?from=search&seid=14364502991437979266)

After finishing the above courses, it's highly suggested to join some simple competitions before you keep going on [`Kaggle`](https://www.kaggle.com/), a well-known data science competition website. You can refer to others' code for inspiration. Free GPU resources are also available on Kaggle. For beginners, the `Getting Started` category is the best place to obtain project experience and practice coding skills. The following two competitions are good options. 

* [**`Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster`**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) A classification task based on structured data.
* [**`Digit Recognizer`**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) A classification task based on hand-written digit images. A convolutional neural network might be involved. For this competition, we provide some [`reference code`](https://github.com/LinguoLi/mnist_tutorial) with different mahcine learning computing package.

## Intermediate

Now we need to expand our sight to the current research topics in *machine learning / deep learning / computer vision*. 

* **Hung-yi Lee (NTU)'s Deep Learning** [`Homepage`](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/courses.html) video link: [`Youtube`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJV_el3uVTsPMxPbjeX7PicgWbY7F8wW9) [`Bilibili`](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av9770302/)

By far, you should be familiar with the basic concepts of *machine learning / deep learning / computer vision*. You might need to participate in a real project in a lab at school (choose a reputed lab carefully) or in a IT company. You may also consider join a more advanced competition on [`Kaggle`](https://www.kaggle.com/). 

Here, we provide a [**`PyTorch coding template`**](https://github.com/seanywang0408/PyTorch-Template) in python for developing a real project. 

## Advanced

Don't rush to dig into these advanced courses. These courses are more specific for certain topics. Only after you have several project experiences, can these advanced courses help you build up a systematic sense of these topics.

At this point, you have mastered the basic skill and knowledge required for *machine learning / deep learning / computer vision* research. But there are still so much unknown placed waiting for you to explore. What you learn here merely provides you with *the way leading to those places*. Begin you adventure now! And enjoy the beauty of maching learning!

## TODO

* How to use remote server
* How to set up a brand new machine, from installing Linux to installing Pytorch （[`Here is a rough instruction in Chinese`](./简陋版装机指导.docx)) ([`Here is the packages list required to set up a system for machine learning research`](./packages-for-a-ML-system-with-links))
* Advanced coding courses
* Papers reading and writing

Any advice or comments to improve this learning schedule is most welcomed.
